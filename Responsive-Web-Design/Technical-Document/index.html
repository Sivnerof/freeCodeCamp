                Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
                Its high-level built in data structures,
                combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding,
                make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development,
                as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
                Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
                Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
                The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms,
                and can be freely distributed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides.
                Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast.
                Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault.
                Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception.
                When the program doesn't catch the exception,
                the interpreter prints a stack trace.
                A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables,
                evaluation of arbitrary expressions,
                setting breakpoints,
                stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on.
                The debugger is written in Python itself,
                testifying to Python's introspective power.
                On the other hand,
                often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source:
                the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

            <header>
                <h2>Variables</h2>
            </header>

            <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
            <h3>Creating Variables</h3>
            <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
            <p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                <span class="variable">x</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="integer">5</span>
                <span class="variable">y</span> <span class="operator">=</span> "John"
                print(<span class="variable">x</span>)
                print(<span class="variable">y</span>)
            </code>

            <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                x <span class="operator">=</span> 4       # x is of type int
                x <span class="operator">=</span> "Sally" # x is now of type str
                print(x)
            </code>

            <h3>Casting</h3>
            <p>If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                x <span class="operator">=</span> str(3)    # x will be '3'
                y <span class="operator">=</span> int(3)    # y will be 3
                z <span class="operator">=</span> float(3)  # z will be 3.0
            </code>

            <h3>Get the Type</h3>
            <p>You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                x <span class="operator">=</span> 5
                y <span class="operator">=</span> "John"
                print(type(x))
                print(type(y))
            </code>

            <h3>Single or Double Quotes?</h3>
            <p>String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                x <span class="operator">=</span> "John"
                # is the same as
                x <span class="operator">=</span> 'John'
            </code>

            <h3>Case-Sensitive</h3>
            <p>Variable names are case-sensitive.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                a <span class="operator">=</span> 4
                A <span class="operator">=</span> "Sally"
                #A will not overwrite a
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="conditionals">
            <header>
                <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            </header>

            <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Equals: a <span class="operator">==</span> b</li>
                <li>Not Equals: a <span class="operator">!=</span> b</li>
                <li>Less than: a &lt; b</li>
                <li>Less than or equal to: a &lt;= b</li>
                <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
                <li>Greater than or equal to: a &gt;= b</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</p>

            <h3>IF</h3>
            <p>An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>
                In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a.
                As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".
            </p>
            <code>
                a = 33
                b = 200
                if b > a:
                    print("b is greater than a")
            </code>

            <h3>Indentation</h3>
            <p>
                Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code.
                Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
            </p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):</p>
            <code>
                a = 33
                b = 200
                if b > a:
                print("b is greater than a") # you will get an error
            </code>

            <h3>Elif</h3>
            <p>The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                a = 33
                b = 33
                if b > a:
                    print("b is greater than a")
                elif a == b:
                    print("a and b are equal")
            </code>

            <h3>Else</h3>
            <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                a = 200
                b = 33
                if b > a:
                    print("b is greater than a")
                elif a == b:
                    print("a and b are equal")
                else:
                    print("a is greater than b")
            </code>

            <h3>And</h3>
            <p>The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Test if a is greater than b, AND if c is greater than a:</p>
            <code>
                a = 200
                b = 33
                c = 500
                if a > b and c > a:
                    print("Both conditions are True")
            </code>

            <h3>Or</h3>
            <p>The or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Test if a is greater than b, OR if a is greater than c:</p>
            <code>
                a = 200
                b = 33
                c = 500
                if a > b or a > c:
                    print("At least one of the conditions is True")
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="loops">
            <header>
                <h2>Loops</h2>
            </header>

            <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</p>
            <p>
                This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages,
                and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
            </p>

            <h3>For</h3>
            <p>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
            Print each fruit in a fruit list:
            fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            for x in fruits:
                print(x)
            </code>

            <h3>Looping Through a String</h3>
            <p>Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Loop through the letters in the word "banana":</p>
            <code>
            for x in "banana":
                print(x)
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="functions">
            <header>
                <h2>Functions</h2>
            </header>

            <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</p>
            <p>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.</p>

            <h3>Creating a Function</h3>
            <p>A function can return data as a result.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:</p>
            <code>
                def my_function():
                    print("Hello from a function")
            </code>

            <h3>Calling a Function</h3>
            <p>To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                def my_function():
                    print("Hello from a function")
                my_function()
            </code>
